This program serves as a simple book inventory management system that allows users to add, display, search, and edit book information


Book Inventory Management System

This C program provides basic book inventory management functionality. It allows users to interact with a list of books, including adding new books, displaying the list, searching for specific books by ID number, and editing book prices. The program differentiates between user and admin modes, with the admin mode protected by a password.

Notes:

The book data is stored in a text file named "BookInfo.txt" in a specific format (ID, Title, Author, Price).
The admin password is read from a file named "password.txt." You can change the password by editing this file.
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the directory where you run the program.
The program does not handle extensive input validation and error checking for simplicity. It assumes valid input in most cases.
This program serves as a basic example and can be extended and improved for more advanced book inventory management needs.
